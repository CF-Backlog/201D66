# Notes 06

> Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. Can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value. Object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. In object variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object. Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window. JS has built-in objects such as String Number Math and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. Arrays and objects can be used to create complex sets of data.

> Element node, you can access and update content using properties such as text-content and inner HTML or using DOM manipulation techniques. An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other. In older browsers, implementation of DOM inconsistent (use jQuery here). Browsers offer tools for viewing DOM tree. DOM trees have four types of nodes: document node - element nodes - attribute nodes - and text nodes. You can select element nodes by id or class attributes, tag name, using CSS selector syntax. Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node: always return Nodelist.
