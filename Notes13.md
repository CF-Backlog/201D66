# Notes 13

> In the beginning... Native Client Applications (NCA) were preferred to web apps due to the ability for persistent local storage. Cookies came along and annoyed everyone always but also improved stuff because loading HTTP request they would slow loading time, send unencrypted data which is bad, and cookies are lame and limited to 4kb of data which makes them super useful (insert sarcasm here)

> HTML5 now allows for a lot of client-hosted storage space that is not transmitted to the server and persists beyond a page refresh. Storage: Based on named key/value pairs. Data can be any time supported by JS stored as a string

> userData is dope, stores 64kb per domain.
