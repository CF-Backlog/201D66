# Notes Nine

> In additon to the css prop covered in other chapters which work with the contents of all elements, there are several that are specific to controling the appearance of lists tables forms. List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties. Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent. Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS. Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.

> The < img > element is used to add images to a web page. You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image. You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format. Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

> Events: browser's way of indicating when something happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked). Binding: the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen on. When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user. You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element. The most commonly used events are W3C DOM events, although there are others in the HTMLS specification as well as browser-specific events.
