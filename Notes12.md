# Notes Twelve

> Required: script included in page along with a single < canvas > node to render chart.

> Charts are better for displaying data than tables. They are easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they are not always easy to create.

> Chart.js: a JS plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, easy.

> At first sight a < canvas > looks like the < img > element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the < canvas > element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.
