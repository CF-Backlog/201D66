# Notes Seven

> The < table > element is used to add tables to a web page. A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the < tr > element. Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the < td > element (or < th > if it is a header). You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes. For long tables you can split the table into a < thead >, < tbody >, and < tfoot >.

> Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. Can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value. Object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. In object variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object. Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window. JS has built-in objects such as String Number Math and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. Arrays and objects can be used to create complex sets of data. Each can also be used within the other.
